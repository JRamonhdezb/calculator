The Odin Project Foundation Calculator project

This is the final project of the Odin Project Fundamentals curriculum. In this project I will have to demonstrate and test everything I learned through the different sections of the course. I will have to demonstrate my understanding of HTML, CSS and JS by building a GUI calculator.
